Using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Machine Learning method to categorise diabetic individuals.

The dataset diabetes-bivar.csv contains information on 

LDA is a method for reducing dimensionality and highlighting differences between groups of observations.
* Dimensionality reduction aims to reduce the number of dimensions (i.e. variables) in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible, making it easier for us to visualise relationships and classify observations.
* Highlighting differences between groups of observations allows us to predict an unknown characteristic of a new observation (in this case, whether a participant is diabetic or not) based on characteristics that we do know (insulin and glucose test results).
