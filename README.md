# Linear Discriminant Analysis to Identify Diabetics

The dataset 'diabetes-bivar.csv' contains information on 144 participants and their glucose test tolerance score (GTT), insulin levels, and whether they are healthy, clinically diabetic (based on GTT), or overtly diabetic. 

I aim to apply the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Machine Learning method to the dataset above to predict the presence of diabetes in new patients. Please see 'Analysis.pdf' for my final report.

LDA is a method for reducing dimensionality and highlighting differences between groups of observations.
* Dimensionality reduction aims to reduce the number of dimensions (i.e. variables) in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible, making it easier for us to visualise relationships and classify observations.
* Highlighting differences between groups of observations allows us to predict an unknown characteristic of a new observation (in this case, whether a participant is diabetic or not) based on characteristics that we do know (insulin and glucose test results).
